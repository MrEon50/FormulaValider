🧮 FormulaValider - Σ/Δ Formula Validation System
🎯 What is FormulaValider?
FormulaValider is a system that automatically checks the correctness of mathematical and physical formulas on many levels.

It's not an ordinary calculator - it's an intelligent validator that "understands" the structure of formulas and can detect errors before you use them!

🔬 Why is it important?
Imagine that:

You are writing a scientific paper and you want to check if the formulas are written correctly
You are learning physics and you are not sure about the mathematical syntax
You are creating a scientific program and you need to validate formulas
You want to automatically check hundreds of formulas in a database
FormulaValider solves these problems! 🚀

🏗️ Σ/Δ (Sigma/Delta) Architecture
The system works in two layers of validation:

🔤 [Σ] SIGMA - Mathematical Syntax
✅ Correct: ❌ Incorrect:
F = m * a F = m *
E = m * c**2 E == m * c²
v = s / t v s / t
P = U * I P = U * (I + R

What it checks:

Does the formula contain the equal sign =?
Are the left and right sides mathematically correct?
Are there no syntactic errors (unclosed brackets, incorrect operators)?
⚖️ [Δ] DELTA - Unit Consistency
✅ Correct units:
F = m * a → [N] = [kg] × [m/s²] ✓

❌ Incorrect units:
F = m * v → [N] ≠ [kg] × [m/s] ✗

What it checks:

Do all symbols have defined units?
Are the units on both sides of the equation consistent?

Basis for future full dimensional analysis
🚀 Future extensions (planned):
🧠 [Λ] LAMBDA - Symbol Semantics
Meaning of symbols (mass, energy, force...)
Type of quantity (scalar, vector, tensor)
Context of the scientific field
🌍 [Π] PI - Conformity with Reality
Verification with the physical knowledge base
Checking the limits of applicability of the formula
Integration with AI/AGI systems
💻 How to use the program?
1. Run the program:
python formulavalider.py

2. Select an option from menu:
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ FORMULAVALIDER ║
║ Validation System Σ/Δ ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ 1. Check your own pattern ║
║ 2. Select a pattern from the ready list ║
║ 3. System information Σ/Δ ║
║ 4. Create sample formulas.json ║
║ 5. Output ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

3. Example of checking the formula:
Enter the formula: F = m * a
Do you want to add units? (y/n): t

Symbol and unit: F N
Symbol and unit: m kg
Symbol and unit: a m/s**2
Symbol and unit: [Enter]

=====================================================
FORMULA VALIDATION: F = m * a
Description: Newton's Second Law of Motion

🎉 CORRECT PATTERN!
───────────────────────────────────

📚 Examples of patterns to test:
✅ Patterns correct:
E = m * c**2 # Einstein
F = m * a # Newton
P = U * I # Ohm's Law
v = s / t # Velocity
Ek = (1/2) * m * v**2 # Kinetic energy
p = m * v # Momentum
W = F * s # Work

❌ Incorrect formulas (for testing):
F = m * # Incomplete
E == m * c**2 # Double equal sign
F m * a # No equal sign
lambda = h / p # 'lambda' is a Python keyword
F = m * (a + b # Unclosed parenthesis

⚠️ Important restrictions:
🚫 Avoid Python keywords:
❌ Incorrect: ✅ Use instead:
lambda = h / p → L = h / p
if = m * a → force = m * a
for = F * r → torque = F * r
class = C → capacitance = C

📝 Formula format:
Use ** for exponentiation (not ^)
Use * for multiplication (don't skip)
Use sqrt() for square root
Functions: sin(), cos(), log(), exp()
